## Software Architect/Lead Tech Backend

Developer passionate about quality code, I like to provide simple and elegant solutions while being robust and efficient.

The Clean Code being one of the principles that I consider important, I do my best to develop by applying it. Likewise, the coverage and quality of the tests is a subject that is close to my heart.

My favorite moments are when badly thought out code has been refactored into functional and maintainable code, or when you have to designate the technical solution for a need.
