# Welcome!

I'm **Benoît Le Gall**, a passionate Software Architect and Backend Tech Lead based in Orléans, France.

I specialize in creating elegant and robust solutions with a strong focus on **Clean Code**, **SOLID principles**,
and comprehensive test coverage.  
My expertise lies in software implementation using Java, Micronaut or Spring, Gradle, and modern backend architectures.
I also design software architectures and have a solid grasp of how modules and services should interact.  
More recently, I’ve focused on software infrastructure management—from provisioning resources to deploying applications.
Finally, I wrap it all in automated workflows, typically with Jenkins pipelines and GitHub Actions.

## What I Do

- Design and develop scalable backend systems
- Lead technical teams and mentor developers
- Contribute to open-source projects (especially in the Micronaut ecosystem)
- Advocate for code quality and best practices
- Infrastructure as Code
- Process automation
